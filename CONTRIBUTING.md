# How to contribute to econnect-examples

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Our vision is to create a wide knowledge base for Compleo Charging Software's eConnect APIs that enables companies to easily enhance their business by usages of those APIs.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a pull request, reviewing, and merging the pull request.

### Creat a New Issue

If you spot a problem with the existing API usage examples, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/CompleoChargingSoftware/econnect-examples/issues/new).

### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/CompleoChargingSoftware/econnect-examples/issues) to find one that interests you. As a general rule, if you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with a fix.

### Submit Changes

When you are finished with your changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Compleo Charging Software team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged with pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
